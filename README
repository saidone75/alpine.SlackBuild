alpine (Alternatively Licensed Program for Internet News and Email)

Alpine is a fast, easy to use email client that is suitable for both
the inexperienced email user as well as for the most demanding of
power users. Alpine is based on the Pine(R) Message System, which
was also developed at the University of Washington. Alpine can be
learned by exploration and the use of context-sensitive help. The
user experience is highly customizable through the use of the Alpine
Setup command.
